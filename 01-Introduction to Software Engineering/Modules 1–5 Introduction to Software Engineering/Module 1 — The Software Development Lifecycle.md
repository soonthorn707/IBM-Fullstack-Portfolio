## 🌐 Module 1 — The Software Development Lifecycle
### Key Takeaways
- 🧑‍💻 Software Engineering = applying scientific principles to design & build software.  
- 📌 Responsibilities = design, develop, maintain software systems.  
- 📈 SDLC improves efficiency & reduces risks:
  - Defines tasks & timelines for teams.  
  - Improves communication between customers, stakeholders, and developers.  
  - Clarifies stakeholder roles & progress checkpoints.  
- 🔄 Core process = Requirements → Design → Coding → Testing → Release → Documentation.  
- 📑 Requirement Gathering = identify stakeholders, set goals, capture & validate requirements.  
- 📄 Key Documents:
  - URS (User Requirement Specification) → user needs.  
  - SRS (Software Requirement Specification) → full functionality & standards.  
  - SysRS (System Requirement Specification) → system capabilities, interfaces, performance, security.  
- 🏗 SDLC Models = Waterfall, V-Model, Agile.  
- 🧪 Testing = Functional, Non-functional, Regression.  
- 👥 Roles = Project Manager, Architect, UX, Developer, QA, Ops/SRE, Product Owner, Technical Writer.
